## Hogwarts

This is a take home assessment for VacayHome Connect.  

I created a simple web application that creates, updates, and deletes students of Hogwarts and/or the courses they are enrolled in.

I decided to build this web application in React.  I'm accustomed to using bootstrap but I decided to use Material's components instead since it's the components used at VacayHome Connect.  As far as styling, I have a single index.css file but I also tried to utilize Material's CSS-in-JS solution.  I also imported my own fonts to fit the overall theme.  Tests, while not my strong suit, leverage Jest and Enzyme.  All in all, I tried some new things on the fly and I'm proud at how it turned out.
